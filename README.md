# Analyzing Diabetes Hospital Readmissions  

## Objectives  
- **Enhance patient outcomes and satisfaction** through preventative measures to increase future profits.  
- **Reduce potential penalties** linked to high readmission rates.  
- Leverage **predictive analytics** to identify high-risk diabetic patients for targeted interventions.

## Steps Taken
- Data Preprocessing using Excel to remove significant missing values and impute missing vaues
- Descriptive Analytics initially in R
- Multiple rounds of predictive modeling
